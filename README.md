# Examples of using Node.js `node:test` package

Added to Node.js in version 18.8, the `node:test` package is a framework for writing unit tests that has similarity with Mocha.  Between the `node:test` and the already existing `assert` package, Node.js core contains a simple test framework.

This repository contains a few examples for using the `node:test` package.

To use the repository, simply clone it to your computer, and make sure Node.js 18.8 or later is installed.  Everything required is baked into Node.js, and there is nothing to install.
